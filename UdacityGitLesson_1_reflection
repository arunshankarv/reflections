How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Allowed me to sequentially process ALL the differences between the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By allowing me to reconstruct the sequence of how I built a project and look for ways to improve.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Pros: I can label the version in a fashion that best applies to my task
   Cons: It is more work to create versions manually

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Their starting intents were different; Git was for managing large software projects in which groups of files go together. Google Docs was not targetted at software development version control.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log tells you the history of changes; Git diff tells you changes between any two specific versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    The confidence that i can rollback to last known good state allows greater fluidity in my work.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For some app development
